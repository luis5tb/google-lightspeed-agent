  Answering complex questions that require combining multiple tools or
  chaining calls across Inventory, Vulnerability, and Advisor APIs. Use
  this skill when a user question cannot be answered with a single tool
  call — e.g. correlating hosts with CVEs, filtering advisories by
  system, or joining data across Red Hat Insights services. [PREFERRED]

## Multi-Step Tool Usage [PREFERRED]

When a user's question requires combining information from multiple tools, you MUST
chain tool calls sequentially to build a complete answer. Do NOT tell the user you
cannot do something if it can be accomplished by calling multiple tools in sequence.

For example:
- "CVEs with known exploits affecting system X" → first find the host (Inventory),
then query its CVEs with the appropriate filter parameters (Vulnerability).
- "What critical CVEs affect my RHEL 8 systems?" → first find RHEL 8 systems
(Inventory), then get CVEs for those systems filtered by severity (Vulnerability).

When a tool supports filter or query parameters, use them to narrow results rather
than retrieving everything and telling the user to ask again.

### Common filter parameters [STRICT]

These parameters are confirmed available — use them directly without a schema lookup.
Do NOT claim a tool lacks filtering support when these parameters are listed here.

**vulnerability__get_cves**: `limit`, `offset`, `sort` (e.g., `-cvss_score`),
`severity` (Critical, Important, Moderate, Low), `known_exploit` (true/false),
`affecting` (true/false — only CVEs affecting at least one system).

**vulnerability__get_system_cves**: `limit`, `offset`, `sort`,
`severity` (Critical, Important, Moderate, Low), `known_exploit` (true/false),
`status` (Applicable, Not applicable), `remediation`
(Applicable — has a remediation available).

**vulnerability__get_systems**: `limit`, `offset`, `sort`,
`filter` (search string for display name or hostname).
Note: this tool returns only systems tracked for CVE analysis — see
**Tool disambiguation** below for when to use it vs. `inventory__list_hosts`.

**inventory__list_hosts**: `limit`, `offset`, `hostname_or_id`,
`display_name`, `tags`, `operating_system`, `order_by`, `order_how` (ASC/DESC).

For parameters not listed here or for other tool categories, call the
corresponding `*_get_openapi` tool (e.g., `vulnerability__get_openapi`) as a
fallback — but prefer the parameters above to avoid large OpenAPI responses.

### Tool disambiguation: system/host listing [STRICT]

Two tools can list systems — they query **different services** and return **different
counts**:

| Tool | Service | Scope |
|------|---------|-------|
| `inventory__list_hosts` | Inventory | **All** registered systems (including immutable/edge) |
| `vulnerability__get_systems` | Vulnerability | Only systems tracked for CVE analysis (excludes immutable) |

**Selection rule:**
- General "how many systems/hosts do I have?" or "list my systems" ->
  **`inventory__list_hosts`** (source of truth for the full fleet).
- "Which systems are affected by CVE-X?" or vulnerability-scoped queries ->
  `vulnerability__get_systems` or `vulnerability__get_cve_systems`.
- When the user says **"inventory"**, always use **`inventory__list_hosts`**.

Always prefer completing the full workflow yourself over asking the user to make
follow-up requests for information you can retrieve.

## Multi-Step Workflow Examples [GUIDANCE]

**"What are the most critical vulnerabilities on my systems?"**
→ vulnerability__get_cves (sorted by severity) → for top CVEs,
vulnerability__get_cve_systems → cross-reference with inventory__get_host_details for
system context → synthesize prioritized report

**"Help me remediate CVE-2024-XXXX"**
→ vulnerability__get_cve (details + severity) →
vulnerability__get_cve_systems (affected hosts) →
inventory__get_host_details (system context for affected hosts) →
summarize affected systems and advise on remediation steps

**"Give me an overview of my infrastructure health"**
→ advisor__get_recommendations_stats (advisor summary) →
vulnerability__get_cves (top vulns) → inventory__list_hosts (fleet size) → synthesize
health report

**"Am I ready to upgrade to RHEL 10?"**
→ planning__get_rhel_lifecycle (support dates) → planning__get_upcoming_changes
(breaking changes) → inventory__list_hosts + inventory__get_host_system_profile
(current versions) → assess readiness

When a request is simple and genuinely maps to a single tool (e.g., "list my hosts" →
inventory__list_hosts), a single tool call is fine. The point is: think first, don't
default to one-and-done.
